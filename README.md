# Project Management System

A Project Management System built with Java Spring Boot, JWT authentication, file uploads, and more. This system helps manage projects, users, and tasks efficiently. It allows managers to assign tasks, monitor progress, and manage the project lifecycle. The system includes role-based access for managers and members.


## Technologies 

* Java Spring Boot: Backend framework.
* Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
* PostgreSQL: Database for persisting data, managed with PgAdmin.
* Docker: Containerization for easy setup and deployment.
* Lombok: To reduce boilerplate code in models.
* JWT for secure authentication and authorization.


## Project Concept and Goal

###  Core Idea:
The project management system is designed to allow managers to create and manage projects, assign tasks to team members, and track project progress. The system supports role-based access, ensuring that managers can perform administrative tasks while team members focus on their assigned tasks.

###  Problems It Solves:
* Efficient Task Assignment: Helps managers assign tasks to the right people and track their progress.
* Role-based Access: Ensures that each user has the appropriate permissions based on their role (Manager or Member).
###  Why Itâ€™s Important:
This system improves project organization, enhances team collaboration, and streamlines workflows by providing a central hub for project management tasks.
